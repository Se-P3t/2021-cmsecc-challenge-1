Let λ(L) be the length of a shortest nonzero element of a lattice L. We present an algorithm which for k∈N finds a nonzero lattice vector b so that |b|2�?6k2)nkλ(L)2. This algorithm uses O(n2(kk+o(k))+n2)log B) arithmetic operations on O(n log B)-bit integers. This holds provided that the given basis vectors b1,�?bn∈Zn are integral and have the length bound B. This algorithm successively applies Korkine–Zolotareff reduction to blocks of length k of the lattice basis. We also improve Kannan's algorithm for Korkine-Zolotareff reduction.},
